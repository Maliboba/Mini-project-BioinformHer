Project-TNF 

**Mini Project: Comprehensive Sequence Analysis of the Human TNF Gene**
This project focuses on the bioinformatics analysis of the human TNF gene, which encodes a proinflammatory cytokine. Through a series of tasks, the project guides you in downloading the gene sequence, translating it into amino acids, identifying Open Reading Frames (ORFs), analyzing nucleotide composition, predicting transcription factor binding sites, searching for functional motifs, predicting coding and non-coding regions, and converting sequence file formats. The project is designed to apply bioinformatics tools and skills in a practical, hands-on manner, providing a thorough understanding of the sequence analysis process.
